Phones buzz, social media explodes, and messages fly through chat groups. Some of it is helpful, some is confusing, and some can be downright dangerous. Knowing what information to trust is just as important as knowing where to go or what to do.</p><h2>The Information Overload During Disasters</h2><p>During natural disasters, residents are bombarded with information from multiple sources—official government channels, news outlets, social media, messaging apps, and word-of-mouth. This information comes at rapid speed, making it difficult to discern facts from rumors or panic-inducing misinformation. The challenge intensifies when people are under stress and making critical safety decisions in limited time.</p><h2>Key Principles for Verifying Information</h2><h3>1. Check the Source</h3><p>Always verify where information is coming from. Reliable sources include official government agencies (LGU, PAGASA, PHIVOLCS), recognized news organizations, and established disaster management organizations. Be cautious with information from unknown social media accounts or unverified personal posts.</p><h3>2. Cross-Reference Multiple Sources</h3><p>Don't rely on a single source. If multiple trusted sources report the same information, it's likely accurate. Check official government websites, recognized news outlets, and established disaster response organizations for consistency.</p><h3>3. Distinguish Between Official Alerts and Rumors</h3><p>Official disaster alerts come through specific channels (PAGASA weather warnings, PHIVOLCS volcanic alerts, LGU announcements). These are released through official media, emergency broadcast systems, and verified social media accounts of government agencies. Be wary of \"warnings\" that come through unofficial channels.</p><h3>4. Look for Specific Details</h3><p>Reliable information provides specific details such as exact locations, times, measurements, and official sources. Vague warnings like \"stay away from the coast\" without specifics are less helpful than \"Evacuation order for coastal barangays Ariman through Rizal due to storm surge warning.\"</p><h2>What to Do During Information Overload</h2><p>In a disaster situation, focus on official channels for safety-critical decisions. Listen to local government radio broadcasts, check official social media accounts of disaster agencies, and ask trusted community leaders for information. When in doubt, use the most conservative approach to protect your family.</p>"},{"id":1,"title":"Community-Based Approaches: Disaster Readiness and Interventions","category":"HOW TO","author":"by Arien Azel San Juan","date":"Jan 18, 2026","image":"https://i.imgur.com/ZGuCSC9.png","excerpt":"Communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters.","fullContent":"<p>Communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters, mainly due to their geographical areas, disaster preparedness, and inability to access appropriate housing designs. This vulnerability has affected thousands of families, prompting organizations and government agencies to initiate projects such as guides and tips for reducing the impacts of natural disasters.</p><h2>Understanding Community Vulnerability</h2><p>Community vulnerability to disasters stems from three main factors: geographical location (proximity to hazards), preparedness level (how well-prepared the community is), and housing adequacy (whether homes can withstand hazard impacts). In areas like Gubat with multiple hazards, these factors compound to increase risk.</p><h2>Building Community Resilience</h2><h3>1. Disaster Preparedness Planning</h3><p>Communities should develop comprehensive disaster preparedness plans that include evacuation routes, shelter locations, communication systems, and supply stockpiles. These plans should be regularly reviewed, updated, and practiced through community drills.</p><h3>2. Housing and Infrastructure Improvement</h3><p>Improving housing standards to meet resilience criteria is essential. Communities can advocate for better building codes, provide technical assistance for retrofitting, and support residents in constructing hazard-resistant homes using appropriate materials and design.</p><h3>3. Community Education and Awareness</h3><p>Regular educational programs about specific hazards, protective actions, and available resources empower community members to make informed decisions. Local workshops on construction techniques, evacuation procedures, and emergency response build community capacity.</p><h2>Role of Community Leaders and Organizations</h2><p>Barangay officials, community organizations, and local leaders play crucial roles in coordinating preparedness activities, disseminating information, and ensuring vulnerable groups receive support. Strong community leadership strengthens disaster resilience at the grassroots level.</p>"},{"id":2,"title":"Why Resilient House Structure Matters: Reducing Disaster Damage in Gubat, Sorsogon","category":"Feature","author":"by Vrille R. Bernales","date":"Feb 19, 2026","image":"https://i.imgur.com/ZGuCSC9.png","excerpt":"Gubat, Sorsogon is prone to multiple hazards. Proper building materials significantly reduce disaster damage.","fullContent":"<p>Gubat, Sorsogon is prone to many kinds of hazards. These disasters may vary depending on location or which barangay or purok you are in. From typhoons, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides, to accidents we cannot avoid during disasters such as falling trees, or even non-natural occurrences like the rapid spread of fire due to closely-built houses. But how does the structure of a house help? Well, did you know that according to Mata et al. (2022), the proper building materials used are significant in helping reduce damage during disasters?</p><h2>This Article Addresses:</h2><ul><li>Disasters affecting coastal, rural, urban, and upland areas in Gubat, Sorsogon</li><li>How important resilient houses are</li></ul><h2>How Different Disasters Affect Structures</h2><p>Every disaster affects houses and buildings differently depending on the type of hazard. For example: Typhoons can damage walls, roofs, windows, and doors. Flooding can weaken soils that serve as foundations for most houses and can also damage floors and leave long-term building material deterioration. Earthquakes may cause ground movement that affects foundation stability and structural columns, crack walls, and cause failure of connections between structural elements, potentially leading to partial or total collapse of poorly designed houses. These impacts show that a house must be designed to respond to more than one type of hazard.</p><h2>Critical Design Elements</h2><p>This website recommends advice about house structure based on your location. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Foundation type and floor level:</strong> Raised floor levels and properly designed foundations are crucial in flood-prone areas and areas with soft soil, while deeper and well-anchored foundations are needed in sloping locations.</li><li><strong>Structural frame and connections:</strong> Columns, beams, and joints should be properly connected to help resist wind force and earthquake movements.</li><li><strong>Roof form and roof angle:</strong> Use roof shapes and slopes that may reduce wind uplift and water accumulation.</li><li><strong>Building materials:</strong> Select materials that are durable, locally available, and suitable for the identified hazards in your location.</li></ul><h2>Location-Specific Design</h2><p>Not all house structures fit every area in Gubat, Sorsogon. A house that suits an urban area may not be safe for rural and coastal areas. With this in mind, house design should always be based on the specific risks in the area where the house will be built. By considering the location where the house will be built, it will allow people to make easier decisions and will significantly improve their safety.</p><h2>The Importance of Resilience</h2><p>Having knowledge on how disasters may affect houses and how structural design can reduce damage shows how important it is in disaster preparedness. By using resilient house structures, homeowners can protect their lives and properties, and maybe contribute to a safer community in Gubat, Sorsogon.</p><p>The Gubat Resilient Housing (GRH) website uses location-based information to help users identify the most suitable house structure for their area. Considering factors such as location, hazard, and environmental conditions, this website provides guidance on appropriate structural design choices that will gradually improve house resilience and safety.</p><p>One of the most important steps in building a house is decision-making. This is where the website comes in to help. Building a safe and resilient house reduces damage and improves safety. By considering house roof design, materials used, layout, and location prone to specific risks—which this website can recommend—homeowners can make easier and better decisions that can lead to safer and more durable homes.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>https://www.gfdrr.org/en/building-regulation-for-resilience</li><li>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings13010107</li></ul>"},{"id":3,"title":"Typhoon-Resistant Roofing: Design and Material Choices","category":"HOW TO","author":"by Gubat Resilient Housing Team","date":"Jan 5, 2026","image":"https://i.imgur.com/ZGuCSC9.png","excerpt":"Strong winds and flying debris during typhoons pose serious threats to roofs.","fullContent":"<p>In typhoon-prone areas like Gubat, roofs are often the first structural elements to fail. High winds create uplift forces that can tear roofing materials from their anchors. Flying debris causes punctures and structural damage. Proper design and material selection can significantly improve roof resilience.</p><h2>Understanding Wind Forces</h2><p>Typhoon winds create both lateral pressure and uplift forces on roofs. Roof edges, ridges, and corners experience the highest wind loads. Hip roofs generally perform better than gable roofs because they have fewer exposed edges and distribute wind loads more evenly.</p><h2>Key Design Considerations</h2><h3>Roof Shape</h3><p>Hip roofs with slopes between 25 and 35 degrees offer good wind resistance. Steeper slopes increase wind uplift; flatter slopes may accumulate water. Avoid large roof overhangs that can catch wind.</p><h3>Anchoring and Fastening</h3><p>Proper fastener spacing and type are critical. Use ring-shank nails or screws rated for high wind zones. Ensure adequate connection between roof framing and wall structure.</p><h2>Recommended Materials</h2><p>Metal roofing (properly anchored) offers good wind resistance. Concrete or clay tiles must be well-secured. Consider impact-resistant materials in debris-prone areas.</p>"},{"id":4,"title":"Safe Zone: Finding Shelter During Disasters in Gubat","category":"Disaster Prep","author":"by Maria Althea Ysabelle Y. Vallena","date":"Feb 19, 2026","image":"https://i.imgur.com/ZGuCSC9.png","excerpt":"Gubat's coastal location makes it vulnerable to multiple hazards. Learn alternative safe zones when traditional evacuation centers are not accessible.","fullContent":"<p>Gubat is a coastal municipality located in the province of Sorsogon with many low-lying areas near sea level, making it vulnerable to flooding, storm surges, and soil liquefaction (Abante et al. 2025). However, during such events, not all evacuees are able to access designated evacuation centres and other safe areas.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to offer guidance on alternative safe locations (depending on the situation) to go to when evacuation centres, schools, churches, and elevated areas are not readily accessible.</p><h2>Checklist to Consider When Choosing Your Safe Zone</h2><ul><li>Is it on higher ground or a hill?</li><li>Is it far from rivers, sea, or steep hills?</li><li>Is it an open space where buildings, trees, or risky materials won't fall or collapse?</li><li>Can you reach that specific area safely by walking, even if it's raining or there is a risk or threat of flood?</li></ul><h2>What to Avoid</h2><ul><li>Any low-lying or flood-prone areas near rivers or coasts</li><li>Steep or unstable slopes</li><li>Old or weak buildings</li><li>Roads, bridges, or underpasses that are damaged</li><li>Areas near power lines, large trees, and any other hazardous materials</li></ul><h2>Alternative Safe Areas to Consider (Depending on the Situation)</h2><h3>Barangay Open Grounds or Courts</h3><p>Some barangay open grounds and courts that are not near rivers or steep hills can be used as temporary safe areas. However, during typhoons, earthquakes, and flashfloods, this area might not be safe.</p><h3>Open Field Areas</h3><p>Open fields can be safe during disasters, but it depends on the situation. They are safer during earthquakes, landslides (if away from slopes), and floods or tsunamis (if on higher ground). However, they can be risky during strong storms, typhoons, or floods in low areas.</p><h3>Sports Complexes or Gymnasiums</h3><p>These can be temporary safe areas during strong winds, heavy rain, and overcrowding because of the large indoor space, and some facilities may be available for comfort. However, people may face risks such as flooding if the area is low-lying. Also, you may experience poor ventilation if crowded, power outages, and danger if the building is not tough enough to withstand the risk of earthquakes.</p><h3>Town Plazas or Parks</h3><p>These offer limited shelter, but in these areas, people can avoid building collapses during earthquakes. However, they may be prone to flooding or strong winds during typhoons.</p><h3>Open Agricultural Areas or Farm Lands</h3><p>These offer limited shelter, but are away from houses, buildings, large trees, and other risky materials that may collapse. However, because of poor drainage, they may be prone to flooding.</p><h2>Important Safety Reminder</h2><p>These tips serve only as general guidance, and safety should always be the main priority. It is still best and strongly advised to follow the instructions and advisories of authorities, as they are essential for us to be safe and to minimize and avoid risks.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>Cruz, J.

Rain drops through rusty roofs, revealing the reality of housing shaped by financial constraints.","fullContent":"<p>Before the storm reaches the streets of Gubat, it already enters some homes. Rain drops through rusty roofs, landing in basins prepared long before weather turns bad. For many residents, this routine reflects a deeper reality: houses are built not to last but to survive with the limited resources available.</p><h2>Vulnerable Roofs: A Common Problem</h2><p>Interviews conducted for the Gubat Resilient Housing project reveal that the roof is one of the most vulnerable parts of many homes. One resident shared: \"Matanda na 'tong bahay, [at] dahil sa katandaan, nabulok [na] yung mga yero\" (This house is old, and because of its age, the iron sheets have rotted).</p><p>Another resident described how structural defects developed over time: \"The roof of our house was built, resulting in constant leaks during rainfall.\" These conditions are not caused by neglect, but by the inability to afford stronger and more durable materials.</p><h2>Material Choices Driven by Affordability</h2><p>For many families, affordability dictates the use of traditional and lightweight materials. One respondent explained: \"Gawa sa anahaw yung bubong namin, kaya pag malakas yung hangin, medyo nasisira sya\" (Our roof is made of anahaw, so when the wind is strong, it gets damaged).</p><p>Cocolumber is also commonly used, despite being easily weakened over time. Adding to these challenges is the widespread presence of termites. As one resident noted: \"Madaming anay dito, isa 'yan sa mga perwisyo\" (There are many termites here, that's one of the problems). Another added with resignation: \"Gusto kong ayusin kaso wala namang pampaayos\" (I want to fix it, but I don't have the means to repair it).</p><h2>Improvisation and Resilience</h2><p>Some families repurpose old galvanized sheets for walls, particularly in kitchens, despite the discomfort caused by heat. These adaptations demonstrate both creativity and hardship—making do with whatever materials are available.</p><h2>Beyond Awareness: Structural Vulnerabilities and Financial Realities</h2><p>These stories highlight how geography can reduce certain risks while other structural vulnerabilities persist. Rather than lack of awareness, they reveal that housing conditions in Gubat are shaped by financial limitations and environmental pressures. Residents recognize the risks but are constrained by limited income, emphasizing the importance of accessible and locally relevant housing guidance.</p><h2>A Response Through Resilient Housing Solutions</h2><p>Through the Gubat Resilient Housing project, we seek to respond to these lived experiences by providing practical and hazard-specific recommendations. By turning voices from the Gubat community into informed solutions, the initiative aims to help ensure that when the rain comes, homes in Gubat are safer places to stay.</p><h2>Source</h2><ul><li>Interview Statements from Group 3 - Gubat Resilient Housing Project</li></ul>"}];
